    <h3>Best Mashed Potatoes</h3>
    <p>The best mashed potatoes are smooth, creamy, and buttery. This is my favorite mashed potato recipe that combines hot boiled potatoes with warm milk and melted butter for light and fluffy results every time. A classic side for the holidays or weeknights!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Lbs Baking Potatoes</li>
        <li>3 Cloves Garlic</li>
        <li>1 Cup Milk</li>
        <li>2 Tbs Butter</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add potatoes and garlic, lower heat to medium, and simmer until potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>When the potatoes are almost finished, heat milk and butter in a small saucepan over low heat until butter is melted.</li>
        <li>Drain potatoes and return to the pot. Slowly add warm milk mixture, blending it in with a potato masher or electric mixer until potatoes are smooth and creamy.</li>
